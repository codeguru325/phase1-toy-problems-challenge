# Speed Detector

This JavaScript function `speedDetector(speed)` checks if a vehicle is within the speed limit of 70 km/h and calculates demerit points for excess speed. It also checks if the total demerit points exceed the maximum allowed points (12).

## Usage

- "Speed is okay." if the speed is within the limit (70 km/h).
- "License expired" if the total demerit points exceed the limit (12).
